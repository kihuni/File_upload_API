# File Upload API

A simple Django REST API to upload, retrieve, list, and delete files.

## Overview

The file_upload_api project includes a single app, file_manager, which implements the following features:

- Upload Files: Accept file uploads via a POST endpoint.

- List Files: Retrieve a list of all uploaded files with metadata.

- Retrieve Files: Download specific files by ID.

- Delete Files: Remove files and their metadata by ID.

- Files are stored in the MEDIA_ROOT directory, organized by date (uploads/YYYY/MM/DD/).

The API is built using Django REST Framework and is accessible without authentication (using AllowAny permissions) for simplicity, making it ideal for development and testing.

## Example with cURL

**Upload a File:**
```
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.txt" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/upload/
```
Response: JSON with id, file, file_url, uploaded_at, and file_size.

**List Files:**
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/
```
Response: Array of file metadata.

**Retrieve a File:**
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/1/ -o downloaded_test.txt
```
Downloads the file with ID 1.

**Delete a File:**

```
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/files/1/delete/
```
Response: 204 with no content.

**File Storage**
- Files are saved in MEDIA_ROOT/uploads/YYYY/MM/DD/.

- The file_url in responses points to the downloadable file (e.g., /media/uploads/2025/06/29/test.txt).

**Testing**
The project includes unit tests for all endpoints. To run the tests:

```
python manage.py test
```
- Test Coverage: Tests verify file upload, listing, retrieval, and deletion.

- Requirements: Ensure the test database is created during the first run.
